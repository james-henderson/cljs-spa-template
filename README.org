* Single Page Light-weight Application Template (SPLAT)

An opinionated Leiningen template to create ClojureScript single page web applications.

Libraries/frameworks used:
- [[https://github.com/jarohen/wiring][Wiring]] - a library to configure and wire-up component-based applications
- [[https://github.com/juxt/bidi][Bidi]] - bidirectional URI routing
- [[https://reagent-project.github.io/][Reagent]] - minimalistic React for ClojureScript
- [[https://github.com/jarohen/oak][Oak]] - a library to structure single-page webapps - taking inspiration from the Elm Architecture

Most of these can be easily swapped out if required.
